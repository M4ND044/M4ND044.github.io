    <h1>Amusing to Me</h1>
    <h3>by Armando Garcia</h3>
    <p>These three websites are most amusing to me because they represent my interest in fashion, athletics and culture. I find myself finding the latest shoe and designer products. Additionally, I am provided with insight and knowledge from flo wrestling on different techniques.</p>

    <h2>Supreme is a street clothing brand and all of their products are very valuble to the right buyer. Like me.</h2>
    <p>The Supreme website amuses my fashion and street wear influence. It also influences my artistry and awarness of culture.</p>

    <h2>FloWrestling is how I stay hip with all high level wrestling news and matches.</h2>
    <p>FloWrestling is very amusing because it teaches me different technical aspects of wrestling. It also shows documentary of historic events in wrestling that inspire motivation.</p>
