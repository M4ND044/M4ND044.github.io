    <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
    <p>Kobe Bryant inspires me and while his time on earth was cut short, his commitment to excellence and inspiration to billions is forever lasting.</p>
    <p>I believe Kobe Bryant was a prime role model for many generations and exposed us to resistant competitive spirit, gracious success and humbling defeat. More importantly, Kobe was a symbol of ambition that exhibited the true natrure of human desire.</p>
